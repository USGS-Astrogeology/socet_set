# SurfaceFit Graveyard #
This a collection of original C++ source, compiled binaries, and Perl scripts that are used for the legacy DTM surface fitting procedure. These are here strictly for historical purposes and should not be used outside USGS Astrogeology unless you really know what you're doing.
New version is now supported here: https://github.com/USGS-Astrogeology/socet_gxp_dev/tree/master/SurfaceFit
